# VICE Front-end Coding Exercise

This is the outcome of an HTML/CSS/JS exercise that involves building a single page app to navigate through various VICE shows. **For this version I adjusted the UX and made the code more efficient/compact.**

## Instructions

- within "dist" folder, preview locally with a static file server like Yarn serve _(use "serve -l 3000" to fetch data from http://localhost:3000/shows.json)_.
- view source code in "src" folder

## Details

- Vue, Vue Router, Vuex
- ES6+
- Stylus
- CSS Grid
- TypeScript
- Webpack

## Notes

This was a fun project! To improve, I'd implement touch controls to scroll through shows. I'd also consider adding a "VICE Shows" block on the left at larger widths, eliminating some of the whitespace while keeping the first show centered.
